	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I understood how to open
		and close the lines and differentiate the various terms. So far, nothing has felt
		entirely difficult to me- just slightly intimidating.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>This page is my result and below is a visible file structure:</p>
